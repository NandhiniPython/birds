# birds image multiclass-classification
A Photographic Collection of Birds for Multi-class Classification

Dataset contains JPG images of varying dimensions.

`birds_annotation.csv` contains `file_name` that corresponds to the image file names and `label` that corresponds to multi-classes.

The four classes described here are:
1. `flying`
2. `standing at elevation`
3. `standing on land`
4. `swimming`

Annotations are made manually.

`birds_labels.jpg` is a pie-chart describing the label-balance.
